# more-glossary
A user-friendly version of the FDA-NIH Modernizing Research and Evidence (MoRE) Glossary.

# Summary
Evidence-building with real-world data in clinical trial research can involve navigating a lanscape chock-full of statistical jargon. Terminology can also differ between fields, resulting in multiple terms with similar, or identical, definitions. This can create confusion with interpreting the scientific record, lowering replicability, and can even cause trouble with regulators. Luckily, an interagency working group led by the NIH and the FDA in the US tackled the problem by developing a concensus glossary of terms in [a recent paper](10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.16674) to help standardize language used for clinical research and evidence. 

While the paper makes the glossary available in a human-readable format, both in pdf and jpeg forms, copying and pasting from those sources can be cumbersome for many applications. To expand its (re)useability, this markdown-based glossary provides an accessible alternative to the primary source. Also, as an open-source platform, it facilitates future deliberation and revisions by the community.
